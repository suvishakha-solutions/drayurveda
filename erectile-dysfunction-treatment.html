									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>

									Ayurvedic doctors use Ashwagandha also known as Withania Somnifera to treat

									<li>Fear about sexual performance</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									The bark of the root obtained from the Withania somnifera plant is recognized for
									its
									powerful aphrodisiac properties. This sattvic herb generates ‘ojas’ and provides
									strength to the penile tissue during sexual activity. It further boosts libido,
									increases stamina and prevents premature ejaculation.
									The churna obtained from the roots when taken in proper dosage reduces mental stress
									and
									fatigue, promotes longevity and effectively treats erectile dysfunction.

									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>

									Vajikarana therapy revitalizes the elements of the body and restores balance and
									health .These formulations improve the reproductive system and enhance sexual
									function by acting on the hypothalamus and limbic system of the brain.
									Vajikarana therapy may also lower anxiety around sexual desire and performance and
									even increase some reproductive hormones..
									Vajikarana therapy uses hundreds of different formulas, each of which has several
									different ingredients. Some Vajikarana preparationsTrusted Source for ED include:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>vrihani gutika</li>
									<li>vrishya gutika</li>
									<li>vajikaranam ghritam</li>
									<li>upatyakari shashtikadi gutika</li>
									<li>medadi yog</li>
									<li>Chlorophytum borivilianum, Asparagus racemosus, and Curculigo orchioides</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									<strong>
										3. Shatavari
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>

									Referred to as ‘Queen of Herbs’, Shatavari which goes by the scientific name
									Asparagus racemosus is an extremely beneficial herb for improving the sexual
									function of both male and female. The tincture or powder when taken regularly boosts
									blood circulation and induces calmness in the mind. The rejuvenative effects of this
									herb nourish the Shukra dhatu and increase sperm production.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										4. Cinnamomum cassia
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									A group of researchers from Turkey conducted laboratory testingTrusted Source of
									Cinnamomum cassia (cinnamon) essential oil on samples of erectile tissue from humans
									and rats.
									The study showed that cinnamon essential oil and its primary component,
									cinnamaldehyde, relaxed the erectile tissue of both humans and rats. If this effect
									occurred in a real-life scenario, it would likely result in an erection.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										5. Tulsi Beej
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Tulsi, also known as the ‘Holy Basil’ has been with us for ages. Thanks to its
									numerous medicinal properties, it is extremely beneficial in treating male
									impotency. The seeds when taken regularly increases blood flow and strength in the
									penile tissue. It is also beneficial for treating loss of libido and general
									debility and improving overall stamina.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										6. Safed Musali
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									This yellowish-white root-like substance obtained from the Chlorophytum borivilianum
									is a potent vajikaran (i.e. an aphrodisiac herb). It helps reduce stress-related
									immune disorder that induces the production of corticosterone, which in turn
									inhibits the production of testosterone. Ayurveda strongly recommends the intake of
									a spoonful of musali every day to enhance sexual appetite and promote sperm count.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										7. Gokshura
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Gokshura churna has a promising effect on improving men’s sexual health. The churna
									has potent spermatogenic properties that hold high significance in treating
									hypospermia (low volume of semen), asthenozoospermia (i.e. sperm motility),
									oligospermia (i.e. low sperm count), and enhances spermatogenesis (i.e. sperm
									production). Being a natural antioxidant, it improves the production of testosterone
									and helps to treat conditions like erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.
								</p>

								<p>
									Apart from the addition of natural herbs in your daily diet, certain exercises when
									incorporated into your regular lifestyle helps to promote a healthy lifestyle and
									fight the symptoms of Erectile Dysfunction effectively.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										8. Kegel Exercises
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									In men, Kegels chiefly target and strengthen the bulbocavernosus muscle. This muscle
									allows the penis to fill with blood during an erection, pump during ejaculation and
									empty the urethra after urination. Pelvic floor muscles or bulbocavernosus muscles
									are the ones that allow you to clench and stop the urine stream several times in the
									middle of urination.
								</p>

								<p>
									To perform Kegel exercises, squeeze those muscles, hold for 4-5 seconds, then relax.
									Repeat these 10 to 20 times, two or three times a day, in different positions
									including sitting in a chair, lying down with your knees up, and standing.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										9. Yoga
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Ayurvedic medicine also includes yoga practice. Practitioners believe that people
									who adopt a regular yoga practice may feel less stressed and have improved overall
									reproductive health. People can often improve their sex life by reducing their
									stress levels. In this way, yoga may help treat mild ED.
								</p>

								<p>
									An article in the International Journal of YogaTrusted Source reviewed the evidence
									on male reproductive health and the practice of yoga. According to the authors,
									Kundalini yoga can stimulate sexual energy.
									They also note that other forms of yoga, such as moola bandha, use specific
									stretches and movements that increase blood flow to the pelvis. These forms of yoga
									may help those with ED.
